I'm Gabe. I do research and consulting in statistical computing with R and frequently collaborate with the R-core development team to add new features to the R language.

My particular areas of interest are:

- Reproducibility and Provenance of ad-hoc analyses
- Improving the R language
- Bridging gaps between sections of the R community
